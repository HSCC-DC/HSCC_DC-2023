        <h1>About Anna Elizabeth</h1>
        <h2>Not To Be Personal, But...</h2>
        <p>My name is Anna Elizabeth Martinez-Graham (and, yes, I have two first names!) I am fourteen years old, my birthday is the 16 of April (so I'm an Aries), and I am Afro-Latina (Mexican). Here's another thing you may not know about me. I have ASD, or autism spectrum disorder, and so I have a different mindset than others, not to mention that I was bullied for being an intelligent student. </p>
