        <h1>About Anna Elizabeth</h1>
        <h2>Not To Be Personal, But...</h2>
        <p>My name is Anna Elizabeth Martinez-Graham (and, yes, I have two first names!) I am fourteen years old, my birthday is the 16 of April (so I'm an Aries), and I am Afro-Latina (Mexican). Here's another thing you may not know about me. I have ASD, or autism spectrum disorder, and so I have a different mindset than others, not to mention that I was bullied for being an intelligent student. Sometimes I even feel out of place with my peers or family. (I'll bring that up later when I talk about my time at BDPA.)</p>
        <p>But other than that, I'm glad that I survived 14 years on Earth and could make some time here for BDPA. This place has its benefits... and flaws...</p>
        <p>So I have a list of character traits, both positive and negative. Some that resemble my parents or zodiac... Anyways, here they are.</p>
        <h4>Positive Character Traits</h4>
        <ul>
            <li class = "disk">Kind</li>
            <li class = "disk">Kind</li>
            <li class = "disk">Kind</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Free Time (...Finally!)</h3>
        <p>I'm a procrastinator and sometimes I'll clear my mind as if I don't have any work to do. But I mostly enjoy drawing, watching YouTube and listening to music (like K-pop!) Sometimes, I'd play video games or knit and I'm thinking about trying to crochet. The one thing I know is that I'm animated, so I will talk to myself and make little motions <b><i>A LOT</i></b>. Also, I air draw with my finger to try to come up with an idea for art.</p>
