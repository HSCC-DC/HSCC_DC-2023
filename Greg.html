                </h1>

                <p class="lead">
                    Hello, my name is Gregory Williams and I am on the BDPA DC chapter and I go to McKinley Technology
                    High School and aspire to have a master-class of knowledge in computer science. On a normal day, I
                    go home after school, do my online Udemy course, some homework, then the day is over. But on
                    Saturdays, I go to Lorton, Virginia to participate in the weekly BDPA classes held there. In those
                    classes we: problem solve, program, have fun, and solve bugs in those programs. After class, I will
                    do some of my course on Udemy, homework, then it’s free time where I usually watch motivational
                    YouTubers like Brandon Carter or JWaller. I aspire to improve my everyday hobbies to better achieve
                    my goal of becoming a man that is influential and reliable, who’s kids will scream “Daddy’s Home”
                    once they notice his car in the driveway. This is my goal because I believe it will give me the most
                    satisfaction to understand what I’m surrounded by, make sure I am not someone who is easily
                    forgotten, and have tenants for myself to be a better person, set by the creator himself. My
                    responsibility on the HSCC team is the front-end as it is what I know best and have been focusing on
                    for some time now, but I do endeavor to learning back-end code as it will improve my competence of
                    computer science as a whole – especially with fully grasping the OSI model. I feel great being on
                    the BDPA DC chapter, and I feel HSCC gives me a time limit for my goals, making me more urgent and
                    excited to compete as I learn more and more as the years pass.
